# Task Number-3: Text Generation with Markov Chains

This project showcases how to generate text using Markov Chains â€” a probabilistic model based on the likelihood of character or word sequences. Unlike deep learning approaches, Markov Chains use statistical relationships between words to produce text that mimics the style of the input corpus.

## Repository Features

The repository includes:

1. Implementation of a basic Markov Chain text generator in Python.
2. Preprocessing of input text to build the transition matrix.
3. Functions to generate new text based on different chain lengths (n-gram models).
4. Examples of generated text from sample datasets or user-provided input.
5. Configurable parameters such as chain depth and output length.

## Use Cases

- Simple text simulation  
- Mimicking writing styles  
- Educational purposes to understand probabilistic models  
- Lightweight text generation without deep learning dependencies

## Purpose

This project is ideal for understanding fundamental concepts of probabilistic text generation. It demonstrates how simple statistical models like Markov Chains can be used to produce surprisingly coherent text using just Python and basic data structures.
